# PathFinding

Created a square grid at least 15x15 nodes in size.

Implemented the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest distance between two nodes.

Via the mouse select a 'start' and 'goal' node.

The heuristic function, chooses Manhattan distance, Diagonal distance or straight line distance.

Visualizes the 'start' and 'goal' nodes, the calculated path, and every node that A* put on the 'open' list.
